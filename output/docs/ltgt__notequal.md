Logical operator [**different from**] used in conditions. The symbols
**&lt;&gt;** and **!=** are synonymous.

It must be used between two numeric expressions, and it returns a logical result:

**False** - If both expressions have the same result (if these two expressions are equivalent), as they ARE NOT different.

**True** - If the expressions have different results, as they ARE different.

### Examples

  **2+2 &lt;&gt; 4** will return **false**.
  **0 &lt;&gt; -1**  will return **true**.
