A comment is an explanatory note about the program. The comments are not
necessary for the program's correct working.

There are two kinds of comments:

- Of a single line: they start with the symbol** //** and finish at the end of the line in which they are defined.

- Of several lines: they start with the symbol** /*** and finish with the symbol ***/**.

### Example
```
/*
    This is an example of a comment
    of several lines in which explanations
    about the program can be given
*/

PROGRAM my_game; // Example of a single line comment.
BEGIN             // The main program starts.
    FRAME;
END               // The main program finishes.
```


All the texts included in a comment are ignored by the compiler.
As many comments as necessary can be put, in any point of the program.

The comments starting with** /*** and finishing with** */** (comments of several lines) can also start and finish in the same line.
