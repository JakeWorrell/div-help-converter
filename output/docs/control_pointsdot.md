**+230,0**The **control points** are defined inside the **graphic editor**
with the bar of control points, indicated with this icon.**-****+231,1****-**---------------------------------------


In order to access the **graphic editor**, suffice will be to &quot;**double-click**&quot; with the left mouse button on a graphic inside the environment (on a map window).

The **control points** are simply points that can be placed inside a graphic for different purposes.

The **bar of control points** allows us to position up to **1000** different points inside a graphic. Each of them will be identified by its number (from **0** to **999**).

In order to position one of these points, suffice will be to select the {number of
point} with the **left arrow** and **right arrow** icons and then, to click on the graphic.

In order to **delete** (unselect) a control point, it is necessary to click on the same  graphic a second time.

---------------------------------------


The only **control point** used by the system is control point number **0** (the first one). This point defines which is the **virtual centre of the graphic** and has many applications inside the language.

When **control point number 0** is not defined, the system
will work as if the graphic's virtual centre was its **real centre** (a point located at half the width and height of the graphic).

---------------------------------------


### Note Once the control points have been defined, for them to have effect in a
program, it is necessary to save the **file MAP** or include the graphic again in the **file FPG** by dragging the former to the latter (depending on which one of both is loaded in the program).
