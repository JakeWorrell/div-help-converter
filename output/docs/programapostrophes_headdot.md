**PROGRAM** [&lt;name&gt;](definition_of_a_namedot.md) **;**

All the programs must start with the reserved word **PROGRAM** followed by the name of the program and a symbol [; (semicolon)](semicolon.md).

This head is obligatory in all the programs. Before it, only one or several [comments](definition_of_commentsdot.md) (explanatory texts preceded by the symbol** //**, or between the symbols** /*** and** */**) can optionally appear.

In the names and reserved words there is no difference between capital and lower case letters, so **PROGRAM**, **program**, **Program**, ... are valid words.

### Example
```
// -------------------
// Listing of my game
// -------------------

PROGRAM name_of_my_game;
BEGIN
    //...
END
```
