The compiler was expecting, at the indicated position of the program, the name
of a structure previously declared, with the intention of declaring it as a pointer.

To define a pointer to a data structure you must use the following syntax:

**STRUCT POINTER name_structure name_pointer;**

**name_structure** being the name of a data structure declared
previously in the program, and **name_pointer** being the name of a pointer
to the structure which is being declared.
