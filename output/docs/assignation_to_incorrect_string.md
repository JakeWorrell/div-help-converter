With text strings you can only realise assignations of three types:

- Conventional assignations (=), a copy of the string to the right of the **=** sign
will be made to the left-hand string.

- Sum and assignation (+=), the substring on the right hand side will be added to the left-hand string.

- Subtraction and assignation (-=), characters of the string will be removed.

If another type of assignation is attempted this error will be given.
