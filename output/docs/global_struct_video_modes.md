**STRUCT video_modes[31];**

    **width;**  // Width of mode

    **height;** // Height of mode

    **mode;**   // Number of mode

**END**


In the global predefined structure **video_modes**, at the beginning of all programs, 
the **list of VESA modes** supported by the PC's video adaptor are detailed (all of them 
of **256 colours**), up to a **maximum of 32** (from [0] to [31]).

The number of found VESA modes is saved in the global variable [num_video_modes](global_num_video_modes.md).

This information is generated by the system automatically, so you don't need
to call any function. For all found modes the following information is registered :

**width** - Number of horizontal pixels of the video mode.

**height** - Number of vertical pixels of the video mode.

**mode** - Number of mode. This value can be used directly as a parameter for the function [set_mode()](set_mode().md).

Once the **width** and **height** of the video mode which you want to activate has been selected,
and therefore the **number of registers** its structure shall consist of has been defined, 
you must then activate it by calling the function with :

  **set_mode(video_modes[**&lt;number of register&gt;**].mode);**

### Note Besides the registered modes in this structure, there also exists a list
of standard video modes, which numbers are contained in the constants
[m320x200 ... m1024x768](videomodes.md).
