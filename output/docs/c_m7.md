Constant: **c_m7**
---------------------------------------


This constant is used to be assigned to the predefined [ctype](local_ctype.md) local variable used to define the type of coordinates that a process will have. Its value is **2**.

This is the value assigned to [ctype](local_ctype.md), used for the coordinates of the graphic of the process to be interpreted as if they were referred to a mode 7 window, three-dimensionally folded in that window.

For further information about the **mode 7 windows**, it is possible to access the [start_mode7()](start_mode7().md) function used to activate them.

There are other constants used for other systems of coordinates.
The whole list is the following one:

    [c_screen](c_screen.md) - Screen coordinates

    [c_scroll](c_scroll.md) - Scroll coordinates

    **c_m7**     - Mode 7 coordinates

    [c_m8](c_m8.md)     - coordinates of mode 8
