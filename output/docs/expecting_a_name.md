To declare a data type you must specify its name after the reserved word **INT**, but in this case it is not so important
(because all the data by default will be of the same type).

### Example
```
PROGRAM my_game;
GLOBAL
    INT a,b;  // declare two whole number data
    c,d;      // declare another two whole number data
BEGIN
    //...
END
```


In this example you can see 4 data of the  type whole number declared, for
the first two (**a** and **b**) the type was specified as (INT) (as in &quot;integer&quot;), 
but there is no difference, in the level of declaration, with the last two 
(**c** and **d**), because these would also be data of the type (INT).
