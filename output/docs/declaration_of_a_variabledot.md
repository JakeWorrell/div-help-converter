[&lt;name&gt;](definition_of_a_namedot.md)

(or, if the aim is to initialise)

[&lt;name&gt;](definition_of_a_namedot.md) [=](equal.md) [&lt;constant&gt;](definition_of_a_constantdot.md)

To declare a variable inside a [GLOBAL](declaration_of_global_datadot.md), [LOCAL](declaration_of_local_datadot.md)
or [PRIVATE](declaration_of_private_datadot.md) section, suffice will be to indicate its name inside that section. In this case, the variable will be initialised at 0 (zero).

To initialise the variable at other values, the symbol [=](equal.md) (assignment) will be put after the name of the variable. The constant value at which the variable is intended to be initialised will be put after this symbol.

A variable is a cell (or position) of the computer's memory to which we refer by its name and that can contain whole numeric values within the range ([min_int](min_int.md) ... [max_int](max_int.md)).
