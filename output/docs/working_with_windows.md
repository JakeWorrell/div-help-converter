The windows, can be moved to any position on screen if you press
on the title bar with the mouse and drag it to the new position.

**Title bar.** - Is the top zone of the window, where the name of the window is shown 
in white against a blue background. When the name of the window appears in grey scale,
it is because the window is not selected (as another window is currently selected ), 
to select it press on it.

**Drag.** - This term is applied inside the graphical environment to mean the action of holding 
the mouse button down over an object, moving it to the new position, and finally releasing the
mouse button.

To ask the system to place the window automatically, you must double click
with the mouse on the title bar of the window. If the system
finds a better position for the window, it will move it there.

The windows can be in **different modes**, and therefore their functions and operations will
be distinct from each other. These modes are described below :

**1. Active windows:** Are those which, normally, have an illuminated title bar, in white letters 
against a blue background and are situated foremost on the desktop.

**2. Inactive windows:** These type of windows have a dark title bar, in black
letters against a dark grey background. To activate one of these windows simply click
on them with the mouse.

**3. Windows in the second plane:** These are windows which are obscured; this is because
they are at least partially, covered by other windows. With these windows you can't 
interact with them until they come into the foremost plane by clicking on them with the mouse.

**4. Icons:** The icons are the minimised windows, this means, the windows which were
reduced temporarily. The icons don't have a picture, just a button
with the sign &quot;+&quot; followed by the title of the window.

### Note To drag the graphics (to a file, to the desktop, etc.) don't press
on the title bar of the window, but on the contents of the window. This means, 
you must press the mouse button in the middle of the window and, without releasing
the mouse button, move it to the new position.
