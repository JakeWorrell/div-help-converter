This symbol is bi functional; it has two different uses, depending on whether it is used as an unary or binary operator.

A **UNARY** operator appears inside an expression, simply preceding an operand (as if it was its sign). In this case, the operator** ^** will be a synonymous of [POINTER](pointer__[__].md).

**Example: ^x** is equivalent to a **POINTER x**

A **BINARY** operator appears inside an expression, concatenating
two operands (showing an operation between both). In this case, the
operator** ^** will be a synonymous of [XOR](xor__caretcaret.md).

**Example: x^2** is equivalent to **x XOR 2**
