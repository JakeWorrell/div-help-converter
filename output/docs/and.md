Bi functional symbol, that has two different uses depending on whether it is used as an unary or binary operator.

An **UNARY** operator appears inside an expression, simply preceding an operand (as if it was its sign). In this case, the operator** &amp;** will be a synonymous of [OFFSET](offset.md).

**Example: &amp;x** is equivalent to **OFFSET x**

A **BINARY** operator appears inside an expression, concatenating
two operands (showing an operation between both). In this case, the
operator** &amp;** will be a synonymous of [AND](and__andand.md).

**Example: x&amp;2** is equivalent to **x AND 2**
