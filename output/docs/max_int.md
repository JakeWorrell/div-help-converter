Constant: **max_int**
---------------------------------------


This constant defines the maximum value that any variable can store in this language. This value is** 2147483647**.

All the data are 32 bit **integers** with sign in this language.
For that reason, only integers within the range
(** -2147483648** ...** +2147483647** ) may be used.

When the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds that range,
the system won't report any error. In order to avoid this situation, much care must be taken.
