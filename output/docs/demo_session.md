

This is a version of DIV Games Studio 2 designed for evaluation purposes only, and is limited  
to 31 executions of the program.

This demo version is completely functional, and was created with the aim that
you could evaluate the possibilities of the program and its compatibility with 
your system, before obtaining the full registered copy.

There are only two restricted functions in this version:

- The **program size** which can be compiled is limited by the
maximum number of objects allowed in this version.

- All finished programs (after creating an EXE independent from DIV with the option
**Programs** \ **Create installation**) will be marked with a message stating this is a demo 
version only.

These restrictions don't exist in the commercial version of the program, but in addition remember
that the full version also contains a **User's manual** which is essential
to access all the functions of the program and to effectively learn the programming 
language of DIV 2.
