The symbols **(** and **)**, called brackets, must always appear in pairs and in this same order.

They are used to delimit some calculations, parameters or conditions
of the programs, marking their beginning with the symbol **(** and
the end with the symbol **)**.

---------------------------------------


Inside an expression, they indicate that the calculation within them must be done before the calculation out of them.

For instance, the expression **2*3+2** will be evaluated as **8**, as the multiplication (2 by 3 equals 6) will be done first and then, the addition (6 plus 2 equals 8).

Using brackets, it is possible to force to do the addition at first,
expressing the calculation as **2*(3+2)**, that will be evaluated as **10**, as now the addition (3 plus 2 equals 5) will be done first and then, the multiplication (2 by 5 equals 10).

---------------------------------------


The brackets are also use to delimit the call parameters of the [processes](call_to_a_process.md) or the functions and inside the syntax of different statements of the language.
