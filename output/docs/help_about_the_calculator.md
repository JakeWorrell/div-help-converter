**How it functions?**

The calculator included in the environment functions differently from conventional
calculators, it is made for programmers, and therefore functions as an evaluator 
of expressions.

Its use is very simple, you write the mathematical expression and press
the **Enter** key. Pressing **F1** will always take you to this help page.

For example, you can type in the calculator the expression 2+2 and press **Enter**;
the value 4 will appear in the results window. To introduce a new expression
the previous one must first be rubbed out, this can be done by pressing the **ESC** key.

It is possible to introduce complex expressions, using parentheses **( )** to indicate
the priorities in the calculations.

---------------------------------------


The **operators** which can be used in the calculator expressions are
the following (indicates all symbols accepted in each operator):

** + -**      Addition and Subtraction.

** * /**      Multiplication and division.

** % MOD**    Modulus, or remainder from whole division.

** &lt; &lt;&lt;**     Binary rotation to the left.

** &gt; &gt;&gt;**     Rotation to the right.

** ^ ^^ XOR** OR exclusive binary.

** | || OR**  OR binary.

** &amp; &amp;&amp; AND** AND binary.

** ! NoT**    Binary negation.

** SQRT**     Square root.


---------------------------------------


The calculator has two cells which can change their {mode of
functioning}. Their options are the following:

**Int** - If this cell activates, all operations will be rounded down 
to whole number values,  as in the language DIV. For example, the result 
of the division 8/3 will be 2.

**Hex** - When this cell is activated, the result will be shown in
the hexadecimal system. Also numbers in this system can be introduced 
inside the expressions preceded by '**0x**' (as in the language).

### Note On the desktop as many calculators as necessary can be opened, 
so many different expressions can be visible simultaneously .
