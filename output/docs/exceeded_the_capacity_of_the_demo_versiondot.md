This DEMO version of DIV Games Studio does not allow us to create programs as big as this one. It can only compile programs of a specific number of variables and processes.

In the complete version of DIV GAMES STUDIO does not exist this limit, being possible to create programs of any size.

The only option to compile this program is first eliminating all the processes and data that are no longer required or indispensable.
