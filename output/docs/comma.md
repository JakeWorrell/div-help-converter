The symbol of the comma ( **,** ) is used inside the programming language,
in different points of a program, **to separate** two consecutive elements of a list.

It is used, for instance, in the following points:

- In the [lists of constants](definition_of_a_list_of_constantsdot.md) to separate their different numeric values.

- In the definition of the [parameters of a process](parameters_of_a_processdot.md) to separate
the names of the different parameters.

- In the [call to a function](list_of_functions_of_the_languagedot.md) and in the [call to a process](call_to_a_process.md) to also separate different expressions that will be assigned to the parameters of the function or process.

- In the [FOR statement](for_statement.md) to separate different initialisations,
conditions or increments.

- In the [SWITCH statement](switch_statement.md) to define the different values
accepted in a block **CASE ... END**.

The symbol of the comma can also be used to separate several
[declarations of data](declaration_of_a_variabledot.md), instead of finishing each of them with a symbol **semicolon** ([;](semicolon.md)).
