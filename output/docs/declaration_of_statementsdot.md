A statement is an order to be executed by the computer in a program. 
The possible types of statements are the following ones:

Assignment statements

    [=](assignment_statementdot.md)


Control statements

    [IF](if_statements.md)

    [SWITCH](switch_statement.md)


Loop statements

    [LOOP](loop_statement.md)

    [FROM](from_statement.md)

    [REPEAT](repeat_statement.md)

    [WHILE](while_statement.md)

    [FOR](for_statement.md)


Break statements

    [BREAK](break_statement.md)

    [CONTINUE](_continue_statement.md)

    [RETURN](return_statement.md)


Special statements

    [FRAME](frame_statement.md)

    [CLONE](clone_statement.md)

    [DEBUG](debug_statement.md)


Call statements

    [Call to a process](call_to_a_process.md)


The statements always appear as a group of statements, from none (which makes no sense) to as many as necessary.

All the statements will sequentially be executed (the first one,
the second one, the third one ...), with the exception of the statements that can control the flow of the program (control, loop and break statements).
