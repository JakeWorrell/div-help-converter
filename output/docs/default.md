This reserved word is a part of the [SWITCH](switch_statement.md) statement, that is used to begin a section of statements that must be executed when the result of the evaluated expression is not contemplated in any of the sections [CASE](case.md) of the statement.

Every **DEFAULT** must have a word [END](end.md) indicating the end of the section.

The [SWITCH](switch_statement.md) statement evaluates an expression. Every section
[CASE](case.md) of the statement will contemplate one of several results in which that section must be executed. Finally, a section **DEFAULT** appears to express &quot;**in case that the result of the expression is none of the previous ones, then the following statements must be executed ...**&quot;.
