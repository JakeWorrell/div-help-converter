Logical operator [**equal to**] used in conditions. It must be used between two numeric expressions and it returns a logical result:

**False** - If the expressions give different results, as they AREN'T equal
(or equivalent).

**True** - If both expressions give the same result (if they are equivalent expressions), as they ARE equal.

### Examples

  **0 == -1**  will return **false**.
  **2+2 == 4** will return **true**.

### Note The symbol [=](equal.md) can not be used to compare two expressions
or numeric values, as it is the assignment symbol.
