Constant: **true**
---------------------------------------


This constant is used to indicate **true** values, to initialise logical variables or
to define logical parameters. That is to say, it must be evaluated as a condition.

Its value is **1** and, as in the language all the **odd** numbers are interpreted as **true**, this constant will be evaluated as a condition that is always complied (**true**).

---------------------------------------


The [false](false.md) constant is opposite to this one, and it is used to indicate logical **false** values.
