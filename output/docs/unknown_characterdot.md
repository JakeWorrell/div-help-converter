A character that does not belong to any symbol of the language 
and that, moreover, **is not valid** to create a new name was found in the program.

If it is a [comment](definition_of_commentsdot.md) it is necessary to indicate it correctly with a symbol
// at the beginning of the comments of a line, or the symbols /* and */ to
indicate the beginning and the end, respectively, of comments occupying more than one line.

If you intend to create a [name](definition_of_a_namedot.md) you must replace that character by another one among the characters allowed by the language.
