

**More flexibility and simplicity in use.** The development environment of DIV Games
Studio has evolved into several smaller modules, and together they form
a more intuitive structure than in the previous version.

---------------------------------------


**+151,0****A new help.** The help section has been restructured, and of course covers
 everything that's new in the DIV language. The window includes a new navigation bar.**-**

**+154,0****Multiple paintbrush sizes.** In the graphical editor paintbrushes of various 
sizes and forms can now be selected, either in monochrome or in greyscale. 
By pressing the key **T** you access the new dialogue; new paintbrushes can also be added, 
adding them to the file **BRUSH.FPG** of the **SYSTEM** directory.**-**

**+155,0****Cover a Picture with coat or textures.** In the graphical editor using the
key **U** you can access the new dialogue where you can select any
of the maps from the desktop as a texture to paint onto the surface of an image 
(with the key **X** you can see and allocate this texture). The **aerosol** tool has
been improved, as has the bar of shade **checkpoints**, and also **new keyboard commands**
were added (such as **K** to copy a graphic in a window, or** +/-** to change the checkpoint).**-**

**+156,0****Graphical visualisers.** Almost all windows to open files
can display a square window **thumbnail** which allow you to view the contents
of these files before they are loaded. It is also possible {to load different
files at once} highlighting them with the mouse while the **control** key is held down
(the **Shift** key allows you to highlight isolated consecutive graphics).**-**

**+157,0****Developed system of files.** In this version the internal management of the FPG files 
has been improved; errors have been eliminated, thumbnails of the contained maps can be viewed,
lists can be printed, a complete FPG file transferred to a map and vice versa.**-**

**+159,0****Sound effects editor.** The audio has been completely revised, permitting many more 
operations, formats and including a **mixer** and **effects editor** of the sound. You can access 
this editor from the sounds menu.**-**

**+160,0****Evaluation of expressions.** Now you can access the new **calculator** windows
(from the system menu) to evaluate numerical expressions while programming, without 
having to exit from the DIV environment.**-**

**+161,0****Sprite Generator.** The character generator is also a new characteristic of this version.
It was made to create a base on which the realistic pictures of humans and animations can be 
realised. These photo-images can then be modified in the graphical editor.**-**

**+162,0****Three-dimensional maps editor.** A menu for 3D maps, their editor
and all functions related to them in the programming language, are also a new characteristic of 
this version of DIV Games Studio.**-**

**+171,0****Time profiles.** From the program debugger you can access, by pressing F11, the time 
profiles of the program. These statistics indicate the time consumption of a process during 
the executing of the program, and allow the manual optimisation of the speed of these programs.**-**

**+153,0****New examples.** Several sample games and programs
developed by users of the previous version of DIV Games Studio are included in this version.
Also, on the CD-ROM you can find multiple shareware utilities available for free use in this 
development environment.**-**

**+172,0****Facility of impression.** This version of DIV Games Studio allows you to print,
in addition to a program list, lists of the graphics contained in the FPG file
and the electronic help pages.**-**

**+173,0****Volume Controls.** Amongst the improvements included in the audio system,
there now exists a better volume level control, in the environment and the program. 
In the CD player window there is a small button which gives you access to the mixer.**-**

**+174,0****Library of graphics.** The library of graphics included in the program has been
enlarged and better structured. Also now maps can be imported of any colour depth in the 
formats BMP, PCX or JPG.**-**

**+175,0****New installation system.** The installation system of the program
has been completely re-done, generating a more compact and protected installation, 
and using a **more intuitive and graphical adaptable interface**.**-**

---------------------------------------


**+176,0****And much more.** Many more small improvements in the environment  exist,
many of them imperceptible, but they make the environment more powerful and easy to use. 
Outlined below you can see in detail the more relevant of these.**-**

- **The process of entering and exiting** from the environment **has been optimised**, as has
the execution of programs from it, also the environment loads faster and all delays between processes 
are shorter.

- The program editor is now **in colour**, highlighting the key-words of the language, 
also you can define more clearly, for example, the tabulation size.

- Now, after loading the environment, you have the option to {continue with the previous
session} or **start a new one**.

- It is possible to select **more visualisation modes** for the environment, depending on the modes
supported by the installed video-card and VESA adaptator.

- A **colour palette editor** simplifies the generation of explosions (which
can now be aborted) and the preparation of the background (a preview is now shown).

- The **speed of the mouse pointer** can be configured using the small bar
presented in the configuration window of the system menu.

- In the fonts windows **a sample of letters appears**, which indicate which collection 
of characters are selected.

- It is possible to generate fonts of **letters with shadows or outlines**, by simply creating them with
an outline of 1 pixel of the background colour.
