The available space to store data records and the program's processes has been exceeded.

This error should never happen, but when it happens it is difficult to resolve. The program is too big for this version of the compiler.

If there is a new version of the compiler or any 'patch' that updates this limitation, it must be updated.

Otherwise, the only option is to eliminate from the program all the processes and [data](reference_to_a_variable.md) that are not required or essential any longer.
