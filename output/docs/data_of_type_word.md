Numerical whole data between 0 and 65535 (16 bit whole value without sign).

Tables of type **WORD** can signify a big saving of memory,
with respect to tables of type [INT](data_of_type_int.md)(which occupy **twice as much** memory). 
But **the fastest will be operations with data of type** [INT](data_of_type_int.md).

See the [adjustment of data in memory](adjustment_of_data_in_memory.md), where the amount of memory 
occupied with the different types of data is shown.
