Constant: **g_y_centre**
---------------------------------------


This constant is used as a parameter of the [graphic_info()](graphic_info().md) function,
to ask for information about the **vertical centre** of a specific graphic.
Its value is **3**.

The **vertical centre** of a graphic will be half the height (in pixels),
if the [control point](control_pointsdot.md) number **0** (graphic centre) has not been defined in the painting tool.

The constants that can be used as parameter of this function are the following ones:

    [g_wide](g_wide.md)

    [g_height](g_height.md)

    [g_x_centre](g_x_centre.md)

    **g_y_centre**
