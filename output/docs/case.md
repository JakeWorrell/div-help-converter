This reserved word is a part of the [SWITCH](switch_statement.md) statement. It is used as the beginning of the different sections of statements that can or can not be executed, depending of the result of the evaluated expression.

Every **CASE** must have a word [END](end.md) indicating the end of the section.

The [SWITCH](switch_statement.md) statement evaluates an expression, and the word **CASE** means &quot;**in case that the result of the expression is ..., then the following statements must be executed ...**&quot;.
