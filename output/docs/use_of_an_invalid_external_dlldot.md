In the indicated position of the program, the aim is to load an invalid **DLL**, which is explained for the following reasons:

- The file with the **DLL** has become corrupted because it has been stored in a damaged environment.

- It is not a **DLL** specifically designed for DIV Games Studio.

- The file with extension **DLL** is not found in the path specified by the [IMPORT](declaration_of_librariesdot.md) statement.

It is not possible to use **DLL** of other languages, as they are not compatible with this language even if all the files have the extension **DLL**.

When this **DLL** has been prepared for this language, check the installation instructions and verify either that the file with extension **DLL** is in the directory of DIV Games Studio, or that the [IMPORT](declaration_of_librariesdot.md) statement specifies the complete path of that file.
