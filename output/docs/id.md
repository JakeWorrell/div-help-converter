The reserved word **ID** is used to obtain the [identifying code](_identifying_codes_of_processesdot.md) of a process while executing.

An [identifying code](_identifying_codes_of_processesdot.md) is a numeric value that **identifies** each of the active processes at any moment (each of the game's objects).

That is to say, **ID** is like a numeric constant, with the only difference that its value will be different for each consulted process.

It is not possible to change the value of **ID**, as it is a simple object of
reading.

Normally, a process accesses this value when it intends to report
to other processes its [identifying code](_identifying_codes_of_processesdot.md).
