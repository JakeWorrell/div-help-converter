The compiler is expecting for a [semicolon (;)](semicolon.md) in the indicated position of the program.

In the language, the following points of the program must be indicated with semicolons:

- The end of the [options of compilation](compilation_options.md).

- The end of the [declaration PROGRAM](programapostrophes_headdot.md).

- The end of a [declaration of data](declaration_of_a_variabledot.md).

- The end of a [declaration IMPORT](declaration_of_librariesdot.md).

- The end of the following statements:

    [Assignments or increments of data](assignment_statementdot.md).

    [Calls to processes](call_to_a_process.md).

    [Calls to functions](list_of_functions_of_the_languagedot.md).

    [FRAME](frame_statement.md), [RETURN](return_statement.md), [DEBUG](debug_statement.md), [BREAK](break_statement.md) and [CONTINUE](_continue_statement.md).


- The end of the beginning of a loop [FROM](from_statement.md).

- And as division of the different parts of a [FOR](for_statement.md) statement.

The compiler will indicate when the symbol **;** is missing in any of these periods.

Moreover, this symbol can be put in other specific points of the programs. For instance, after any other type of statement, even if, in this case, it will be optional and, therefore, the compiler will not notice its lack.
