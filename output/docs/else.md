This word is a part of the [IF](if_statements.md) statement, and is used to specify where the block of statements that must be executed starts when the condition specified in the [IF](if_statements.md) is not complied.

The format of the [IF](if_statements.md) statement is the following one:

**IF (&lt;**condition**&gt;)**

    // Code to execute when the condition is complied

**ELSE**

    // Code to execute when the condition  **isn't** complied

**END**


The meaning of **ELSE** is &quot;**otherwise ...**&quot;.

---------------------------------------


The section **ELSE** is optional. The [IF](if_statements.md) statement can be formulated in the following way:

**IF (&lt;**condition**&gt;)**

    // Code to execute when the condition is complied

**END**


When no statement is required to be executed **in the opposite case**.
