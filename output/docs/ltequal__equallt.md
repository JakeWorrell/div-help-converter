Logical operator [**less than or equal to**] used in conditions. The symbols **&lt;=** and **=&lt;** are synonymous.

It must be used between two numeric expressions, and it returns a logical result:

**False** - If the first expression ISN'T less than or equal to the second one.

**True** - If the first expression IS less than or equal to the second one.

### Examples

  **2+2 &lt;= 3** will return **false**.
  **2+2 &lt;= 4** will return **true**.
