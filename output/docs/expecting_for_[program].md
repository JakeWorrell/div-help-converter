All the programs must start with the reserved word **PROGRAM** followed by the program name. Before this word, only can appear [comments](definition_of_commentsdot.md) (explanatory texts preceded by the symbol // or between the symbols /* and */)
or the [compilation options](compilation_options.md).

Check if the word has been correctly written, as no difference is made between uppercase and lowercase letters. Therefore, **PROGRAM**, **program**, **Program**, ... are valid words.

### Example
```
// -------------------
// Listing of my game
// -------------------

PROGRAM my_game;
BEGIN
    LOOP
        FRAME;
    END
END
```
