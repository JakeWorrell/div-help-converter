Whole numerical data between 0 and 255 (8 bit whole value without sign).

The tables of type [ BYTE](data_of_type_byte.md) can signify a big saving of memory,
with respect to the tables of type [INT](data_of_type_int.md) (which occupy **4 times more** memory). But
**the fastest operations will be with data of type** [INT](data_of_type_int.md).

See the [adjustment of data in memory](adjustment_of_data_in_memory.md), where the amount of memory 
occupied with the different types of data is shown.
