Constant: **false**
---------------------------------------


This constant is used to indicate **false** values, to initialise logical variables or
to define logical parameters. That is to say, it must be evaluated as a condition.

Its value is **0** and, as in the language all the **even** numbers are interpreted as **false**, this constant will be evaluated as a condition that is never complied (**false**).

---------------------------------------


The [true](true.md) constant is opposite to this one, and it is used to indicate logical **true** values.
