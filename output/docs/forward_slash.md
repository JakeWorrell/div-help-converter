Arithmetical operator of whole **division**. This operator is used in the [arithmetic expressions](definition_of_an_expression.md) between two operands, to obtain the quotient
of the first one divided by the second one.

For instance **7 / 3** will return 2 as, on doing the whole division of 7
by 3, the quotient will equal **2** (and the remainder will be 1).

That is to say, **n / m** will always return the result of the division of **n** by **m**, but with no decimals (as all the variables are 32 bit **integers** with sign in the language).

The **remainder** of a whole division is obtained through the operator [MOD](mod__percent.md) (module).
