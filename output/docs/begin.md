This reserved word shows the beginning of the program or process.

That is to say, the word **BEGIN** is used to separate the area of data declaration of the main program or of a process, from the area of statements.

The **BEGIN** declaration is obligatory in the main program and in all the processes.

When a program or process are executed, they will always start with the statement coming after **BEGIN**.

The **BEGIN** statement **does nothing**. It is only used as a delimiting element inside the structure of the programs.

---------------------------------------


Every **BEGIN** is directly linked to an [END](end.md)  that will mark the end of the area of statements of the program or process.
