Literals are **texts in inverted commas**. In the indicated position of the program, a literal starts but it is not closed.

All the literals must be closed in the same line as they started. It is not possible to define literals occupying more than one line.

The literals may start and finish with the character [['](double_quote__apostrophe.md)] or even with the
character [[&quot;](double_quote__apostrophe.md)] (but they have to start and finish with the same character). There are two ways to include the character [[&quot;](double_quote__apostrophe.md)] in a literal, supposing that the aim is to define a literal containing the text: a&quot;B&quot;c

 - Duplicating the character: &quot;a&quot;&quot;B&quot;&quot;c&quot;

 - Defining it with the simple inverted comma: 'a&quot;B&quot;c'

It happens the same regarding the character [['](double_quote__apostrophe.md)], that can be included in a literal if it is duplicated, or if the literal is delimited with the character [[&quot;](double_quote__apostrophe.md)].
