The reserved word **UNTIL** is a part of the [REPEAT](repeat_statement.md) statement,
whose syntax is, broadly speaking, the following one:

[REPEAT](repeat_statement.md)

    [&lt;statement&gt;](declaration_of_statementsdot.md);

    ...

**UNTIL (&lt;**condition&gt;}**)**

The [REPEAT](repeat_statement.md) statement implements a loop, it is capable of repeating a set of statements a specific number of times.

The end of the statement is determined by putting the reserved word **UNTIL**
followed by the condition that must be complied so that the **statement finishes**.
