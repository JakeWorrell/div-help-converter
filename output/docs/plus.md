Arithmetic operator of **addition**. This operator is used in the [arithmetic expressions](definition_of_an_expression.md) between two operands, to obtain their addition.

For instance **2 + 6** will return 8, the result of 2 plus 6.

All the variables are 32 bit **integers** with sign in the language.
Therefore, only integers within the range ([min_int](min_int.md) ... [max_int](max_int.md))} can be used. Then, when the result of the **addition** must exceed that range, **incorrect results will be shown**. In this case, the system won't report any error. Hence, much care must be taken.
