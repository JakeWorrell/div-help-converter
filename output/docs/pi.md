Constant: **pi**
---------------------------------------


This constant defines the equivalence in **degree thousandths** of the mathematical constant **pi** (approximately **3.14159265** radians).

Its value is **180000** degree thousandths (180 degrees), equivalent to
**pi radians**.

It is normally used to define angles. For instance, **180 degrees** could be defined as **pi**,** -90 degrees** as** -pi/2**,
**45 degrees** as **pi/4**, etc.
