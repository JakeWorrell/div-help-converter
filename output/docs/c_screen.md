Constant: **c_screen**
---------------------------------------


This constant is used to be assigned to the predefined [ctype](local_ctype.md) local variable used to define the type of coordinates that a process will have. Its value is **0**.

**This is the value by default of** [ctype](local_ctype.md), used for the coordinates of the graphic of the process to be interpreted as if they were referred to the screen. The (0,0) coordinate is the upper left corner.

There are other constants used for other systems of coordinates.
The whole list is the following one:

    **c_screen** - Screen coordinates

    [c_scroll](c_scroll.md) - Scroll coordinates

    [c_m7](c_m7.md)     - Mode 7 coordinates

    [c_m8](c_m8.md)     - coordinates of mode 8
