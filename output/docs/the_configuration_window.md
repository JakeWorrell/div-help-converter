With help of the option **System\Configuration** you can access the following dialogue window
divided into sections, which are outlined below.

**Colours windows**

This first section establishes the colours used by the environment; the colours for 
background of the windows, the colour of letters / fonts and the colour of the title 
bar can be selected. To change these colours click on the boxes. The system not
only uses these three colour windows but, starting from them, generates a gamma array
of colours used for texts, cursors, buttons, etc.

**Programs Editor**

This establishes the appearance of the program windows. Different colours for different objects
(words or symbols) presented in the program can be selected.

**1.** Background of the edition window.

**2.** General colour of letters.

**3.** Cursor.

**4.** Commentaries of the programs.

**5.** Symbols and operators of expressions.

**6.** Reserved words of the language.

**7.** Numbers inside the program.

**8.** Literals, or texts in inverted commas.


The text blocks marked inside the editor are seen with the interchanged colours of paint
and background.

A text box allows you to define the size (n number of spaces) of the tabulator in the
programs editor, as a number between 1 and 16. By default the program tabulates every 
4 columns.

It is also possible to select here the size of the letters of the programs and the help,
from 6x8 up to 9x16 points. All fonts of letters are fixed for a particular setup.

**Painting Program **

Defines the quantity of memory reserved to carry out operations in the graphics editor,
the speed of the mouse pointer and its representation.

The quantity of &quot;memory&quot; is specified in Kbytes, and by default is set at
1088Kb (more than one megabyte), but it is not necessary to modify this value even if 
an operation can't be realised in the graphical editor because of not enough memory available
(in this case the program will divert more memory to it). Please note though, that the more memory
reserved for graphics, the  less memory will be disposed in the system for the rest of the actions.

The speed of the mouse pointer is defined with the small horizontal bar (faster
to the left and slower to the right), and affects the mouse in all window environments,
not only the painting program.

**Global options of the environment**

**1. Emergent windows.** Indicate all windows effects to be visualised, 
when they are opening, closing, minimising, etc. If this option is deactivated,
the environment will lose these effects but will gain a faster response speed.

**2. Move complete windows.** With this option enabled, windows will show their 
complete content whilst being dragged, otherwise only the outline will be shown.
It can be useful to deactivate this option on slower PCs.

**3. Always save session.** Means that when exiting from DIV Games Studio, the contents
of the desktop and all its objects (programs, maps, sounds,etc.) must be saved. 
If this option is deactivated then entering and exiting from the environment will be faster,
but there is a risk of losing the work which was not saved prior to exiting from DIV.

**4. Colour of the lists.** Indicates that, when a file with the extension PRG is being edited, 
all colours previously selected for the editor must be applied. Alternatively only the colours 
of the background and cursor will be applied. The same applies when you are editing a file 
which is not a PRG **div source program** file.

### Note If you close the configuration window or press the key ESC all changes you have just made
will be lost, and the values of the previous configuration will be restored.
