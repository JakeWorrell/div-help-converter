Constant: **c_scroll**
---------------------------------------


This constant is used to be assigned to the predefined [ctype](local_ctype.md) local variable used to define the type of coordinates that a process will have. Its value is **1**.

This is the value assigned to [ctype](local_ctype.md), used for the coordinates of the graphic of the process to be interpreted as if they were referred to a scroll window, to coordinates with respect to the foreground's graphic.

For further information about the **scroll windows**, it is possible to access the [start_scroll()](start_scroll().md) function used to activate them.

There are other constants used for other systems of coordinates.
The whole list is the following one:

    [c_screen](c_screen.md) - Screen coordinates

    **c_scroll** - Scroll coordinates

    [c_m7](c_m7.md)     - Mode 7 coordinates

    [c_m8](c_m8.md)     - coordinates of mode 8
