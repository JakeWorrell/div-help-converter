Logical operator [**bigger than or equal to**] used in conditions. The symbols **&gt;=** and **=&gt;** are synonymous.

It must be used between two numeric expressions, and it returns a logical result:

**False** - If the first expression ISN'T bigger than or equal to the second one.

**True** - If the first expression IS bigger than or equal to the second one.

### Examples

  **2+2 &gt;= 3** will return **false**.
  **2+2 &gt;= 4** will return **true**.
