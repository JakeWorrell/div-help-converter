In this section it is explained how to execute the Sample games of DIV Games Studio and
quick instructions how to start learning about DIV, receiving the first notions about 
this programming language.

**General instructions**

All included games are simple examples, they don't pretend
to compete with the commercial games which can be created with this tool.
Although we're talking about complete games, the majority of them are very simple 
or very short.

The aim was to demonstrate the techniques which are used and how the programs are
made, by use of examples, instead of huge lists of instructions in which the user gets
easily confused.

### Note These games can never show the true capabilities of this environment, 
because practically no single game uses all of them. The majority of the new
and potential capabilities of this version of DIV Games Studio weren't used
in these example, giving you the opportunity to be the first persons who
attempt, or maybe manage, to explore these possibilities to the full.

To execute any of these examples you must, first, load the program with the
option **Programs\Open program**, and then a window will appear with a list
of the loaded programs.

**The help system**

One of the best ways of learning the DIV environment; after placing the cursor
on a reserved word, constant, variable, function, etc., of the language you can 
press the key F1 to see a help page about this subject.

If, after pressing F1, help about the subject doesn't appear (but instead the general index
appears) it is because this is not a specific word of the DIV language, and the data or process 
is not directly from the game language (processes are functions which control the behaviour 
of the graphics, or 'sprites', in the games).

### Note We recommend you begin by learning with simple games, as tutorials or, better still,
with the examples included in the electronic help; to access them you must press
the Functions button in the help window and, from this page, access the different explanations 
of the functions of the programming language, from where small examples can be viewed by 
pressing on their headline or title.

Texts which begin with the symbol // (double bar) are explanation comments,
they don't form part of the program, but only consist of &quot;explanatory notes&quot;
about the internal functioning of the program. These comments are often a big
help in understanding the functioning of the programs. The comments can also
appear between the symbols /* and */ (covering many lines of the program).

To go to one of the program processes (one of the program blocks used to control a graphic 
or sprite of the game), you must press the F5 key and select the name of the process with 
the help of the mouse.

**Execution of the examples**

To execute one of the loaded programs, press with the mouse on its
window and then with the key F10 (this action can also be instigated with the option 
programs \ execute).

The contents of the games are different, but the majority of them allow you to exit
by pressing the ESC key and are managed with the cursor and control keys (See the 
[general commands in the games](common_commands_in_the_games.md)).

The Pause key can be used in all games to immediately stop the execution of the program. 
All programs can be aborted at any point, independent of their programming, if the 
combination of keys ALT+X is pressed.
