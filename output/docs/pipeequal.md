Operative assignment. Binary operation of **logical addition** (**OR**).

The [assignment statements](assignment_statementdot.md) are used to calculate expressions and **assign them** to a variable.

[&lt;reference to a variable&gt;](reference_to_a_variable.md) **=** [&lt;expression&gt;](definition_of_an_expression.md) **;**

If the symbol** |=** is used instead of **=** to perform the assignment,
the following **logical addition** will be assigned to the variable:

  [**previous_value_of_the_variable**] OR [**result_of_the_expression**]

Example: **x=5; x|=6;** -&gt; (x=7)

---------------------------------------


### Note This symbol is a simple abbreviation derived from the **C language**. Anyhow, the **n  |= m;** type statement will be equivalent to this other **n = n OR m;** statement.

See the operator [OR](or__pipepipe__pipe.md) for further information about the **logical addition**.

### Note don't confuse this symbol with that of [**different from**] expressed as [!=](ltgt__notequal.md), that is used to compare whether two expressions have different results.
