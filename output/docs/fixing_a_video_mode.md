The option **System \ Video mode** gives access to the dialogue window which permits
you to modify the resolution used by the graphical environment of DIV Games Studio 2.

The video resolutions are indicated as the number of horizontal and vertical pixels 
the video will be displayed in on screen in this mode and will be a value between 320x200 
(low resolution) and the max resolution which your video card permits. To select
a new resolution you must click on the list which appears in the window over the resolution
desired and then select the button **Accept**.

### Note Some of these video modes can be visualised incorrectly
(for example, a resolution which is permitted by your video card but not by your
monitor); in this case you must wait **15 seconds** for the environment to
restore the previous resolution. Don't press any key, don't do anything, just be 
patient and wait.

**Selection of the system font.**

There are two settings allowed to select the font used by the system, which not only 
have differences in the size of the letters but, also in the
size of the windows of the environment. They are :

**1. Small font (and small windows).** In this mode all windows,
menus and pictures are seen in a small size, being ideal for low modes
of resolution or a PC with a big monitor (17&quot; or more).

**2. Big font (and big windows).** This mode can be activated
only in resolutions from 640x480 up and is ideal for small monitors (15&quot; or less).

### Note The font of letters used in the programs and in the help window is
independent from that selected for the system, and is defined in the configuration
window, also accessible from this system menu.
