development environment.

Using this electronic help you can access a lot of information about
this environment, but even so, the learning of the programming language and the menu options
are described only in the **User's manual**.

### Note If you are using the DIV programming environment for the first time,
you should know that in order to exit from DIV (or any game created with DIV),
you should use the key combination **ALT**+**X**.

DIV Games Studio appeared on the market in December 1998 as the first development environment 
with a programming language designed exclusively for games programming.

In the beginning, our wish as developers was not the creation of a
professional environment, but more to create a simple and interesting environment which
could serve as an introduction to the fascinating world of games development;
something like a &quot;game to make games&quot; in which any person could learn how to program.

The very good response to DIV1 leads us to make this second version of the environment,
in which the same philosophy is maintained.

A great number of received opinions, criticism and wishes permitted us to create 
the new DIV Games Studio with improvements in all areas. We intended to improve, although only 
a little, all areas of the environment. In this sense there are major differences with the 
previous version, (and they are very practical and logical ones).

We would like to thank everyone who has supported our ideas and this product.
At the time of releasing this second version we don't know if an alternative to the DIV environment
exists, which although on the one hand seems regretful, it does give us pride in the knowledge
that such an environment exists here.
