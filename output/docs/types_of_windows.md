The windows can be classified by their function, into the following groups:

**1. Interactive dialogues:** These are windows which are used to impart
information to the user; there exists a huge variety of them, which you'll see in 
the respective options.

**2. Error message Windows :** Are the dialogues in which the title bar appears in white
against a red background and inform the user about the problem which has arisen.

**3. Options Menus :** These menus contain the list of options which call other
menus, windows or dialogues after they have been clicked on. All these menus stem from the
main menu. Some menus may have certain options disabled (a pointer is shown with the 
prohibited symbol if you place the  mouse over it); this is because
these options interact only with the specific types of windows, and there is no
window of this type currently active (it must be created or loaded beforehand).

**4. Programs:** In these windows the programs are created and are effectively text windows.
To edit a program its window must be activated (only one program window can be activated at 
any one time). The text is similar to that of other text editors (supports the standard DOS 
command EDIT).

To ask for help in a program about a specific word of the programming language you must 
place the blinking cursor (not the mouse pointer) on it and, then,
press the key **F1**. These windows can be changed in size by pressing on the
their lower right button and dragging with the mouse or by pressing the keys **control**+**Z**.

**5. Maps or graphics:** These windows are those which contain a map (bitmap) or
graphic and are controlled with help of the menu of maps.
They can be loaded from a MAP file (proper format), or imported from
a PCX, BMP or JPG file. To edit the graphics you must double click with the mouse  button 
in the centre of these windows thus opening, in this way,
the graphics editor (described in the **user's manual**). These graphics can
be dragged to the background (to make a copy), to another graphic (to insert in them), 
to a file of graphics (to include them) or to the trash (to delete them), to drag them you
must drag from the centre of the windows, and not from the title bar.

**6. 3D Maps:** These are vector maps created in the 3D maps editor,
how a collection of closed polygons is shown in their window representing the 
vertical section of a plan. Its creation is not a trivial matter, and is explained in
the **user's manual**. These maps are saved on disk in files with the extension WLD.

**7. FPG or graphics library files :** These windows show the contents of one
file on the drive. These files are libraries or collections of graphics used in the
game. Their purpose is to load a large quantity of maps into a game. They have two
basic modes of function, activated with the help of buttons named &quot;Info&quot; and &quot;Images&quot; 
along the bottom of the window. When the &quot;info&quot; button is not activated (by default), graphics
can be created and moved, or dragged (to the background, to other files, maps or the trashcan).
When the  &quot;info&quot; button is activated, the graphics codes and their
descriptions are displayed with a thumbnail image. These FPG files are always 
controlled from the FPG file menu.

The FPG file windows are always just a reflection of the &quot;graphics file&quot;
contained on the hard disk of the PC, and therefore can be closed at any time,
without need to save them before. Their contents will never be lost.
The option **Files \ Save** allows you to make a copy of the FPG saving it under another
name (as temporary or security copy).

**8. Fonts of letters:** The fonts or letter types are small windows which
display the current typography. You must click on them with the mouse to see an
example of the font in real size. They correspond to FNT files (official font format)
and are controlled by the fonts menu, from which you can access the fonts generator, 
which is the tool used to create new fonts of letters. The fonts of letters are used 
inside the painting program and in the programs to write texts.

**9. Sound effects:** These windows represent on screen a PCM file (press code
modulation) or WAV file with a sound effect. They are controlled with the sounds menu, so 
you can create new effects (with the sound recorder) or edit them. You can find a 
library of sound effects already prepared for use in the games. To hear these
sound effects you must have a sound card compatible with the Gravis Ultrasound or
Sound Blaster family, correctly configured and then click over one of these windows.

**10. Musical modes:** Songs in the formats MOD, S3M and XM can be loaded . 
They are represented in a small window which allows you to activate or stop its
playback. You cannot compose new modules from the environment though.

**11. Help window :** It is controlled mainly with the mouse, but you can also use
the cursors, and the PageUp, PageDown and BackSpace keys to return to the previous page. 
In the help windows the texts are shown in white which make reference to
other help pages. You must click on these references to access to these pages.
In the help windows are also shown example programs which can be selected by clicking on 
their title, executed with the key F10 and closed by clicking ALT+X.

**12. Calculators:** The calculators windows function as evaluators of
mathematical expressions, in the style of expressions presented in the programs.
Their functioning is very simple, because you need only introduce an expression and
press Enter to see the result. You can use parentheses to indicate subexpressions.

### Note The trash window must be activated first from the system menu, with the 
corresponding option (**System \ Trash**).
