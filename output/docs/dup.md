This word is used to define [lists of constants](definition_of_a_list_of_constantsdot.md) (numeric values),
by repeating a simple pattern. It is used to initialise the initial values of tables and structures.

Its syntax is as follows:

&lt;number of times&gt; **DUP (**&lt;sequence to repeat&gt;**)**

It is equivalent of putting the &lt;sequence to repeat&gt; the indicated &lt;number of times&gt;.

For instance, the sequence **1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3** would be equivalent to the sequence **3 DUP (1, 2, 3)**.
