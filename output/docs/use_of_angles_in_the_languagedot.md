In the language, all the angles are specified in degree thousandths.
For instance:

  **0** is **0 degrees** (to the right)

  **90000** are **90 degrees** (up)

 ** -45000** are** -45 degrees** (down right diagonal)


If **360 degrees** (360000) are added to or subtracted from any angle, an equivalent angle is obtained. For instance, the angles -90000 and 270000 are equivalent (the angles of **-90 degrees** and **270 degrees**
go both downwards)

The constant [PI](pi.md) predefined as **180000**, **3.1415 radians** or, what is the same, **180 degrees**, can be used as reference. For instance, **PI/2** will be equal to 90 degrees (90000).

Some of the functions dealing with angles are mentioned below:

  [get_angle()](get_angle().md)

  [get_distx()](get_distx().md)

  [get_disty()](get_disty().md)

  [fget_angle()](fget_angle().md)

  [near_angle()](near_angle().md)

  [advance()](advance().md)

  [xadvance()](xadvance().md)


All the processes have a predefined local variable called **angle**
which, by default, will be equal to **0**. If its value is modified, the display's angle of the graphic of the process will be changed (the graphic will rotate in the indicated degrees, from the original graphic).
